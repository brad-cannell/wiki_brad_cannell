## Overview

This needs to be improved a lot. Just trying to get it moved over from OneNote right now. Eventually, I should add some stuff about using versioning instead of multiple documents. 

## Deep work

2023-12-19: I was listenting to Deep Work this morning in the car. He was talking about all the reasons why a lot of authors (like Malcolm Gladwell) donâ€™t use social media much. It got me thinking that publishing my papers on social media is probably a low-yield return activity. Perhaps I should just switch to managing a single webpage or my LinkedIn profile. 

## Links

Link to the publications list. (this was a broken link when I moved it over from Sharepoint. I do need to come up with some way of tracking manuscripts, though)

## When a paper is published

(This is copy and paste from SharePoint. It needs to be cleaned up a lot.)

1. Add to PaperPile/Zotero. 

2. Update the Publishing and Dissemination Planner board. 

  a. Add publication date 

  b. Add links as attachments 

  c. Move card to the published bucket 

3. Update Annual goals 

4. Add to CV 

5. Add paper to LinkedIn Profile 

  a. You may want to "friend" all the coauthors before you share below. That way, it is easier to tag them. 

  b. Add to LinkedIn profile 

6. Promote paper on social media  

  a. Create a social media post in Canva. Add text to Notes that you can copy and paste (add hashtags) 

  b. Share the post to Instagram business (post) and personal (story) 

  c. Share link to paper on FB business. Add link to the article in comments section. It will be clickable. 

  d. Share post on personal page too.  

  e. Share link to paper on LinkedIn. Add link to the article in comments section. It will be clickable. 

  f. Share link to paper on Twitter. Add link to the article in comments section. It will be clickable.
