## Which technology(ies) to use?

(This section is from SharePoint and can probably be deleted.)

I wrote this up in a pretty detailed way in the Technologies section of the [Authoring SOPs](https://uthtmc.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/SPHCannellResearch/Shared%20Documents/SOPs/Authoring%20SOPs.docx?d=w0b37d1a9a906412dbfc55d9c275c8681&csf=1&web=1&e=Usz9k5) SOP.

### Bottom line

-   Use **Word** for

    -   files that need to be shared broadly with others. Especially if those others are outside of UTHealth. For example, manuscripts, grants, and documents for my classes.

    -   Documents that need citations. I'm not aware of a citation manager that works with OneNote. For example, manuscripts and grants.

-   Use **OneNote** for

    -   Not much
