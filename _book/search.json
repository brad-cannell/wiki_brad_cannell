    "text": "2.4 Due dates\nOriginally, I had plan for how to use due dates that involved the buckets feature. In theory, I really like this plan. In reality, what has ended up happening is that I assign due dates to almost every task. Due dates then essentially function as reminder dates. When a task does have a hard due date, I write it down in the notes section of the task.\nI’m playing with this and think I want to add it. When a task is in the “🗓 Tasks With Due Dates” bucket, a due date is an actual due date. When a task is in the “👨‍💻WIP - No Due Date” or “🔜NEXT - No Due Date” buckets, the due date is simply my internal target date.\nI’m keeping a record of the old system here because I think it is worth thinking more about and or trying again at some point in the future.\n\nIf a task has a hard due date\n\nAdd it to the Tasks with Due Dates bucket and fill in the due date field\nSort the Tasks with Due Dates bucket in Descending order (most distal tasks at the top of the column). Do this for at least the following reasons:\n\nMany tasks are first created in the Inbox bucket. When you use the drop down selector to move it to the Tasks with Due Dates bucket, it is placed at the top of the bucket. Moving many tasks to the bottom of the column (which is what we would have to do if we sorted in ascending order) takes a ton of time.\nSorting in this way forces you to look over tasks with due dates out in the future as you are scanning for tasks due today. That makes you less likely to forget about them.\n\n\nIf a task doesn’t have a hard due date\n\nAdd it to the WIP or Next bucket.\nFor now, use the due date field as a “reminder” date. In the future, we can probably create a reminder that is sent out every X number of days from the creation date.\nUpdate the due date field as the date comes and passes.",

Planner and todo don’t allow free text. I can create a note in my Team, but it won’t have a checklist. OneNote sort of has checklists, but they are weak!\nFor now, I’m just using Apple Notes for my plan for today. They do everything I want and I can access them on my computer or my phone.\n\nCan you set task reminders in Teams (similar to ClickUp)?\n\nThe point of this is to get a reminder on a certain date without setting a “due date”. That allows you to save the due date field for actual due dates.\nNot really. But, you can create reminders and tasks from posts. Actually, you may be able to do it with power automate.\n\nCan you set recurring tasks in Teams?\n\nYes, but you have to use power automate.\nIn a pinch, you can also just manually change the date to the next month.\n\nCan I see all tasks in Teams or projects?\n\nYes! In teams, click on the three horizontal dots, then click “Tasks by Planner and To Do”\nI cannot see all tasks assigned to one of my students unless they all happen to be assigned in one channel. Then, I can just filter. Another hacky way to see them all in Tasks by Planner and To Do is to jointly assign all tasks to my students and to myself.\nThe tasks in the “Tasks” list, under My tasks To Do in Tasks by Planner and To Do comes from the “To Do” app accessible from Outlook. I can imagine using this list similarly to how I use plan for today in ClickUp.\nIn the planner app, I can also see all tasks assigned to me by clicking “Assigned to me” on the left sidebar menu.\n\nCan I make personal/overview task list like I do in ClickUp.\n\nYes, I could either create an overview Team or Channel.\nInstead of thinking about the Brad Cannell task list as a place to view all tasks like Overview in ClickUp, maybe just think of it as a place to put tasks that don’t fit anywhere else. Think The planner homepage as being more like the overview page in ClickUp.\n\nCan tasks be assigned to more than one task list/plans?\n\nI don’t think so. I’m not sure this is really a problem though.\n\nCan I create task templates?\n\nSort of. It looks like I can import bulk task lists with Excel and Power Automate?",
