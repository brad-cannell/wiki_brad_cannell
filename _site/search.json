I would have to jot down a quick note in Apple Notes and update the Quarto file later.\n\n\nI can view my SOP when I’m offline by opening the qmd files.\nIt doesn’t feel like it’s necessarily easy to make quick updates to my SOPs. However, I’m not sure how big of a deal that is. SOPs are meant to evolve over time, but they also probably shouldn’t change often.\n\n\nQuarto works pretty well with mobile by default.\nMaking tables with Markdown syntax isn’t ideal.\n\n\nThe formatting options include almost anything that can be done with CSS and JS, as long as I have the willingness to learn to use them.\n\n\n\nIt looks like it’s possible to integrate ChatGPT. At least on the coding side. I’m not sure about using it on the browser side while searching the wiki.\n\n\n\nI can make edits directly from GitHub (I added this in GitHub)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nCan I restrict access to certain pages?\nHow do I make comments and notes on pages?\n\nYes. Instructions here. Blog post here."
